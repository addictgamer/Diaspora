atom.hpp contains code for atoms.
molecule.hpp contains code for molecules.

TODO: Figure out how to get all this psuedo-simming correctly, and how to realistically simulate all this.
Also figure out how the universe works so that I can properly simulate all this.
For now, I'll just have to use programmed reactions...And then figure out how everything works as I'll get ideas by attempting to simulate the universe.
I'll become a great theoretical phsycist and crazy blarg like that!
Blarg.
I'm gonna have to study more theoretical physics and see what's feasible regarding how the universe works.
